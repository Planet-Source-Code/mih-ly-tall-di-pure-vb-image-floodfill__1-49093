Hi!
You can find two versions of the program here:
  In "ImageFill\" , you will find the main project, the
     Floodfill-with-image thing.
  The "Pure_FloodFill\" directory contains the previous version
     of the program. This is without image filling capabilites,
     but it's a fully working FloodFill code.
     This is without comments.

I hope You will find this code useful. If you like it, you're
free to use this in your projects.
